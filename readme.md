# Windtalkers

A cheesy movie and javascript widgets that display wind data from Remote-Wind ([blast.nu](http://www.blast.nu))
The idea is to have a single JS file that can be included in a page that will transform containers on the page into widgets.

See [the demo](http://remote-wind.github.io/windtalkers/) for examples.
See [the contributing guide](contribute.md) for developer details.
